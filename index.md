You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/notcat/portfolio/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

When you are put on board with a new team, you get the pleasure of fixing what the people before you did, and doing it right.

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/notcat/portfolio/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
